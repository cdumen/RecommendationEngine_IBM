In this project, I have tried to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. For that purpose, I have performed below steps:
 I. Exploratory Data Analysis
 II. Rank Based Recommendations
 III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
 IV. Content Based Recommendations
 V. Matrix Factorization
